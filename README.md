# Text-compare

Simple python based program, which takes two input string and tell the difference beetwen them. The idea came from a facebook post in which i couldn't spot the difference beetwen the original post and the edited. 

In the output the red means removed part, the blue means added part, the yellow means modified and the green means the result of a modification.

Source is in the subfolder, a bit messy but maybe usefull.
